## Project Overview
The UH ITS Ask Us AI chatbot aims to transform the user experience on the Ask Us page by providing a virtual assistant capable of intelligently navigating a database of articles to answer user inquiries. This enhancement streamlines the information retrieval process, offering a more efficient and user-friendly interaction.

## Solution Approach
Leveraging the OpenAI API, our chatbot is trained to interpret and extract pertinent information from the ITS Ask Us database articles. By synthesizing content from these articles, the chatbot can address queries with information that may not be explicitly detailed within the articles themselves, showcasing a nuanced understanding and application of the knowledge base.

## Features
- **AI Chatbot**: Designed to comprehend and utilize database articles to respond to user queries.
- **Admin Page**: Allows administrators to manage the article database and view analytics on chatbot performance.
