## What the project is about
Our team will develop an AI chatbot that will serve as a virtual assistant for users who visit the UH ITS Ask Us page. The chatbot will be designed to read through the database of articles to extract relevant details to answer user queries. This improvement will make the ITS Ask Us page more user friendly because it can eliminate the option for users to manually search and read through multiple articles.

## How will we solve the problem
We will use the OpenAI API to train our chatbot to answer questions based on the articles in the ITS Ask Us database. The chatbot will be able to read through the articles and extract relevant information to answer user queries. The chatbot will be able to answer questions that are not explicitly stated in the articles by using the information it has learned from the articles. The chatbot will also be able to answer questions that are not explicitly stated in the articles by using the information it has learned from the articles.

## Use Cases
User: Upon navigating to the “Ask Us” page, users are met with a few options. The main component of the page is an input bar that allows you to ask a question to the AI chatbot. When you enter the question, the AI will respond to your question and link you to relevant articles. After asking a question, you can give feedback on the performance of the bot. There will also be an account system, which allows users to create or log into an account. Users who are logged in will have additional access to their past session’s queries in the chatbot function described above. Additional features to help users navigate to helpful articles may be added later.

Admin: In addition to all functionality included as a standard user, admins are able to access an admin page, which contains information such as data analytics regarding chatbot performance. This page also includes the ability to create, read, update, and delete from the article database.
